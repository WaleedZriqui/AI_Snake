First to start make envierment (Implement Game Class) we implement pygame 
and pytorch:
So we should install all the depandeces and start by import conde to mange 
enviermnet (If u don't have an anaconda go to 
https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution and install it, 
after that connect conda with python in Vscode)



Go to bash terminal for example :

** Now after that Go to VScode
$ conda create -n pygame_env python=3.7
$ conda activate pygame_env

** after that install pygame
$ pip install pygame 

** next thing that we need is pyTorch (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) 
choose Pip and get this line:
$ pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

now we need 2 more things also libraries:
$ pip install matplotlib ipython

after that if u want to run our code:
$ python agent.py
